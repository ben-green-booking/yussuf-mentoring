## Part 3 - Separation of concerns

### Description
Let's try and solidify some of the concept we discussed last week by doing some further refactoring, and writing some tests for different layers.

### Objectives
* Extract a repository layer which wraps around the Pets collection
* If there is time - Populate tests for the service and repository layers. Speak to Mobin or Laman about this.
